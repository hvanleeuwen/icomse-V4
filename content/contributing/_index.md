**Instructions for how to prepare material for donation**

Do you have educational materials you are eager for the i-CoMSE community to use, develop, or provide feedback on?

To have your materials stylized with the i-CoMSE templates as below, we recommend choosing either (1) JupyterBooks or (2) Markdown. Donâ€™t know what these are? We can do this for you!
