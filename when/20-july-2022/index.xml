      <description>Note: Applications have now closed. Applications are now open for the DFT for Catalysis Summer school at Mississippi State University! Density Functional Theory (DFT) has become an essential tool for modeling chemical reactions due to its relatively low computational cost and favorable scaling with system size. This course will present a theoretical and practical introduction to computational techniques for studying chemical catalysis and kinetics. Participants will learn practical aspects of DFT calculations and advanced topics such as the effect of solvation on chemical reactions.</description>
